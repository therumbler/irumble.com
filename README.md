##### SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

*   Python (inc. asyncio)
*   Perl
*   Apache Kafka
*   SQL
*   JavaScript
*   Business Intelligence & ETL

##### TUTORIALS

I've written 3 parts of my [Asynchronous Programming in Python 3](/tutorials/python3) course.

The [first Python 3 lesson](/tutorials/python3) shows you how to create, and host, a public Python 3 web application FREE.

##### THINGS

I spend way too much of my spare time creating small coding projects, usually Python-backed web apps, with crude HTML & JavaScript front ends.

As of March 2019 I typically use these frameworks

*   [Python 3's asyncio library](https://asyncio.readthedocs.io)
*   [AIOHTTP](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/) as an asynchronous HTTP library, both client and server.
*   [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for user interactivity & [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) for state management.
*   [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) & [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Microsoft for editing code

Below are some of the 100+ projects I've created

*   [First Tweet](/firsttweet/) allows you to search for the first time some text was mentioned on Twitter.
*   [Music Deals](/deals/music) is a daily updated list of music instrument & professional audio deals in Canada.
*   [LCBO Deals](https://www.lcbodeals.com) is a list of the best deals on the Liquor Control Board of Ontario's website.
*   [.djayMidiMapping](/djaymidimapping/) is a post about [Algoriddim's djay software](https://www.algoriddim.com/), and the how to manually edit the .djayMidiMapping XML files to customize a MIDI controller's functionality.
*   [Juke Nukem](/jukenukem/v2/) is an incomplete JavaScript prototype of a beats-per-minute visualiser for electronic dance music. If you click "play", and wait 40 seconds for the drums to start, you should see the beats.
*   [Domain Search](/domains) was one of my first attempts at using asynchronous Python 3 code. It uses Google to find the most searched for terms, based on what you type in, then finds checks the .com domain names for availability
*   [Twitter Trending](/adhoc/autocomplete.html) is a silly dingus I created just to try the `<datalist>` HTML tag for auto-completion.
*   [Podcast Search](/podcasts) is an experiment with using a WebSocket connection for asynchronous client/server communcation. I wrote the server side code multiple times in [a](https://www.tornadoweb.org) [bunch](https://sanicframework.org/) [of](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart) [different](https://docs.aiohttp.org) Python 3 frameworks as an opportunity to learn them.
*   [Sequencer](/sequencer) is a Web Audio implementation of a step sequencer to create drum beats. It was my first attempt at using Web Workers for accurately scheduling events.
